## Introduction

Dive into the world of regression analysis with our project this project aimed at teaching the fundamentals of regression analysis with a practical focus on house price prediction. This repository offers a hands-on approach with Jupyter notebooks, guiding you through various regression models such as Ridge, Lasso, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, and KNeighborsRegressor. Designed for beginners, it provides a comprehensive introduction to data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, all within the context of a real-world dataset. Start your journey into regression analysis and predictive modeling by cloning this repository, and explore the exciting possibilities of data science in the real estate domain.

## Environment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Install `virtualenv` if you prefer it over the built-in `venv` (optional):
        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        ```
    - Create the environment:
        - With `venv` (Python 3.3+):
            ```bash
            python -m venv env
            ```
        - Or, with `virtualenv`:
            ```bash
            virtualenv env
            ```
    - Activate the environment:
        - Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        - Unix/MacOS: `source env/bin/activate`
    - To deactivate: `deactivate`

2. **Dependencies**:
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Installation Instructions
